# Sten Unblocked / stenunblocked.github.io
Sten Unblocked is a website featuring many unblocked games, almost all stored at github pages.

Sten Unblocked Games/Stens Unblocked aims at providing unblocked games for school who blocked freedoms of students by installing a webfilter like FortiGuard, etc. Sten Unblocks usually manages to surround this filter, however if not, there is a replit version available at https://replit.com/@stenunblocked/Sten-Unblocked-Proxied?v=1, which proxies requests made to Sten Unblocked.

# API
Sten Unblocked is open source, and therefore its API is free from any costs.
